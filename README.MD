# If I were to spend more time...

- More atomic commits, these would be a pain to review and not how I like to work
- More unit testing
- Implement user model to store user info, authentication
- Split views into separate files for better re-usability, get rid of ugly nested ternaries
- Add custom fonts
- Dark mode
